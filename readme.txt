The provided Arduino code implements a LED sequence where five LEDs are controlled to light up in a specific sequence with different time durations. The code is designed to run on an Arduino board, and the LEDs should be connected to digital pins 2 to 6 with suitable current-limiting resistors.

The main functionality of the code is to turn on each LED one after another, with each LED remaining lit for a different amount of time before moving to the next one. The sequence will then repeat from the beginning, creating an appealing and dynamic LED display.

Key Components:

LED Pins: The code starts by defining an array of integers representing the digital pins connected to the LEDs (pins 2 to 6). These are declared as constant variables to ensure they do not change during the program's execution.

ON Times: Another array of unsigned long integers is declared to hold the ON times (in milliseconds) for each LED. Each element in this array represents the duration that the corresponding LED will remain lit before turning off.

Initialization: In the setup() function, all the LED pins are set as OUTPUT using the pinMode() function. This step is essential to configure the pins to output mode so that the Arduino can control the LEDs.

LED Sequence: The primary logic of the code resides in the loop() function. It consists of a loop that iterates through each LED in the sequence and turns it on for the specified ON time using the digitalWrite() function to set the corresponding LED pin HIGH. After the ON time has elapsed, the LED is turned off by setting the pin LOW.

Timing Control: Instead of tracking time using variables and millis(), the code uses the delay() function to control the timing of each LED. The delay function provides a simple way to introduce pauses in the code, effectively implementing the different ON times for each LED.

Looping: After the last LED in the sequence has been turned off, the code cycles back to the first LED and continues the sequence indefinitely. The sequence will repeat as long as the Arduino is powered on.

Overall, this Arduino code creates an engaging LED sequence, with each LED turning on and off with unique timings, showcasing the developer's proficiency in Arduino programming and electronics. The flexibility of the code allows for easy modification of the ON times and LED pins, enabling customization to suit various LED displays and projects.
